                  information about your device's location, which can be either
                  precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends
                  on the type and settings of the device you use to access the
                  Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies
                  to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
                  location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
                  allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
                  access to the information or by disabling your Location
                  setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you
                  may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
