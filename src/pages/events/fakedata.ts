  description:
    "The Indian healthcare sector is growing at a brisk pace due to its increasing coverage and expenditure as well as improved services by public and private players. \n\n Indiaâ€™s competitive advantage lies in its large pool of well-trained medical professionals, and is competitive in cost compared to its peers in Asian and Western countries. The cost of surgery in India is about one-tenth of that in the USA or Western Europe. \n\n India Health will offer a full-scale exhibition hosting more than 300 exhibitors with official country pavilions including the USA, Germany, South Africa, Korea, Taiwan, China and Poland. The show will be complimented by a robust 3-day educational programme in support of the countryâ€™s healthcare strategy, well-tailored by leading local associations and covering topics including imaging and diagnostics, PPP, primary care and more.",
